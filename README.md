# Video RAG-based Q&A System

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built with **Streamlit** that allows you to:
- Play locally stored videos
- Transcribe their audio into text
- Build a semantic search index (FAISS) over the transcripts
- Ask natural language questions and retrieve relevant video segments with timestamps
